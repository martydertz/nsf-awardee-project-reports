# nsf-awardee-project-reports

1. The higher-level, NSF-wide stacked barcharts showing directorate due and overdue project reports by submission status
2. Drill-down, division-level stacked barcharts showing program officer due and overdue project reports by submission status.

The Drill-down creates file folders in the user's working for each directorate so the visualizations are organized and easy to distrubute to grants officers, division directors and other analysts at NSF.
